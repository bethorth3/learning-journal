# Additional thoughts on lesson 3 Stretch Goal

Having listened to the lesson and read everything, I feel like I missed a whole section in lesson two on VS Code. I'm still trying to figure it out and hope it works. I have written out the process of ACP sequentially and in my shorthand version there are at least 20 steps to make these changes. 

I'm now 3 lessons into 102 and a few other notes to think about are 
1. Strongly suggest self guided students have 2 monitors. That was a game changer for me and has helped me keep going.
2. I was going to skip the part in lesson 3 after Craig says to start the lab. It was quiet and I left it on in the background. I was able to partially hear some of the questions from the class and used some of their answers to get to this point.
3. If you record more classes, I'd suggest the instructor restate the questions asked by the students in the room. The recording didn't pick up student voices very well, and I could usually only hear part of Craigs answers.
