#Lesson of class 2- Install Fest is Hard!

##There is a lot of information in there to learn.


I struggled with the installs until Marc sent me a different tutorial. It was similar to the first one, but explained some steps in a lot more detail. I still was not able to get node.js to install, but Marc said we won't use that until the 201 course. 

My best explanation of a text editor is that it is a program that helps you edit and manage text and files. There are many out there. Some of them work with each other, but some don't. An example is that Ubuntu can read Microsoft but Microsoft won't read Ubuntu. People tend to use more than one based on what the end goal is, and may change as new features get added in updates. But you always code in plain text.

Things to look for in a text editor are code completion which is when you start typing in the code and the editor program finishes it, or offers ideas of how to finish it. Learning the TAB secret seems like it will be helpful. Another thing to look for is syntax highlighting. I really found that helpful working through the lab. I could see where I was in the hierarchy based on the color and highlight of the font. The article says a variety of themes is helpful. As I said, the colored font on the dark background helped me quite a bit to see where I was within the code. Multiple extensions is the last thing the article says is important as they add functionality. 

So far I've been using Ubuntu when I need it. I did like the lesson on Visual Studio but feel like I have a long way to go to be proficient. 

I did learn some shortcuts, or cheats, during the lessons. I need to print the cheatsheet they give for the keyboard commands and have it beside me. I think that will speed things up.  Within the editor is the command line. This is the starting point for telling the terminal what you want it to do. On the command line you type different symbols, words, or abbreviations that each editor interprets and acts on to create what you want. You have to know different commands based on what you are using, but there is quite a bit of carry over. For example cd seems to always mean change directory, but you can also move around the directories using ~ or . or ..  . If you can't remmeber which directory you are in type pwd to see your current directory. If you want to see what is in that directory you type ls to see a list of those items. 

One of the coolest things I learned about is hidden files. If I type ls -a it will show a hidden file. Hidden files don't show up in a list. They can be hidden for many reasons, but most are because they are part of an operating system and and altering them will change how things function.
