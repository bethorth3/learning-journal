# This is the explanation of Github to share with a non-technical friend as a blog post.


###### This is an example of a really small Heading


This adventure into coding has been really interesting. So far I've learned about repl.it and GitHub, which are both ways to create a website. I won't go to far into repl.it right now, but it was a very fun way to get a quick taste of making a website using HTML and CSS. HTML is a mark up language that dictates what an area on the page should be, whether it is a box, sentence, field, etc. CSS makes that area look pretty. There are many tutorials out there to help with getting started, or you could take the Delta V 101 course.



I would recommend you go on to the Delta V 102 course from there. In that course, we have learned that GitHub is a way to create a website. An example of this would be my Learning Journal for the [102 course](https://bethorth3.github.io/learning-journal/). I also learned to add a license, go into GitHub pages and pick a theme, and how to format the page. By formatting I mean using a markdown language, like GitHub Markdown, to make the words and symbols on the page look the way I want them to look. Go to the link above and you'll notice that I have a heading at the top of my page that is in bold. I did that by putting the hashtag, or octothorp, in front of the line with the words. The more octothorps you add, the smaller it gets-Look above at the second line. 



I have a link near the bottom of my page that shows some [markdown examples](https://bethorth3.github.io/learning-journal/markdown-examples.html). I've learned how to create a list, add links to other sites,  and am learning other types of formatting like how to make a word stand out in *italics*. By using syntax, or symbols, I can manipulate what a word looks like, or where it exists on the page. 



This is all so amazing to learn. You should really look into this course if you need something new to think about!
