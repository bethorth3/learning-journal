# Cloning- the lessons I've learned so far about cloning

*Cloning is a good way to keep things organized and be able to use VSCode*


### Cloning can be considered unethical in some arenas of life, but its a good thing in coding. 

Before I start on cloning I'll tell you a little about Git and version control systems. There are 3 types of version control, local version control (VCS), a centralized version control system (CVCS), and a distributed version control system(DVCS). 

Git is a DVCS. It tracks all changes and watches for corruption of loss of information. It is always in one of three states commited, modified, or stages. Commited means that your data is securely stored in your database. You could be doing a bunch of work and not be ready to actually save the information to the database. That is when the file is in the modified state. Git will flag a file's new version to be committed. This is called the staged state. 

I've been learning more about cloning, and thought the commands seemed easy until I tried to do it without the instructor walking through each step. Having it written sequentially has helped me figure out where to go next I think. Cloning is basically taking the repository that is created in GitHub and saving the link in the local folder. Then use VS Code to make changes to the repository and follow the process for add, commit, push. 

Add means to make changes within the file. Commit means to save the changes. When committing something you should keep track of what changes you made and why. This is how you  can find a mistake or error later if needed. Once the changes are committed, you will push those changes which are on the master, or local, repository, to the origin, or server from which it was cloned. Once you've made changes, commited them and pushed them back you can you go back to your github page and refresh it then follow the steps to make it a webpage. Easy. ish.
