# Cloning- the lessons I've learned so far about cloning

*Cloning is a good way to keep things organized and be able to use VSCode*


### Cloning can be considered unethical in some arenas of life, but its a good thing in coding. 

Before I start on cloning I'll tell you a little about Git and version control systems. There are 3 types of version control, local version control (VCS), a centralized version control system (CVCS), and a distributed version control system(DVCS). 

Git is a DVCS. It tracks all changes and watches for corruption of loss of information. It is always in one of three states commited, modified, or stages. Commited means that your data is securely stored in your database. You could be doing a bunch of work and not be ready to actually save the information to the database. That is when the file is in the modified state. Git will flag a file's new version to be committed. This is called the staged state. 

I've been learning more about cloning, and thought the commands seemed easy until I tried to do it without the instructor walking through each step. Having it written sequentially has helped me figure out where to go next I think.
